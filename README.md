# Python-Libraries-for-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates essential data manipulation tasks using **NumPy** and **Pandas**. It covers array operations, data handling, and dataset transformations to extract meaningful insights efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Features
### NumPy
- Created single and multi-dimensional arrays
- Utilized built-in mathematical functions
- Performed array slicing, indexing, and conditional selection

### Pandas
- Worked with Series and DataFrames
- Read and processed CSV and HTML data
- Applied sorting, filtering, and missing value handling
- Used `.apply()` for function applications
- Merged datasets with `pd.concat()` and `pd.merge()`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numpy-pandas-project.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

## Usage
- Modify the dataset paths in the script as needed.
- Run the script to see NumPy and Pandas in action.
- Experiment with different operations to understand data handling better.
